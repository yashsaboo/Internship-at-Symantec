# noPhish
In 2018, I interned at Symantec, Pune, India. I researched and developed an anti-phishing solution to identify phishing websites in real-time for Norton Browser Extensions such as ‘Norton Safe Web’ and ‘Norton Safe Search’, with the Security Analysis and Response (STAR) Team.

- Coded automation script to scrape and extract >100 features for >100k phishing sites using Data Mining and Computer Vision.
- Ran a classification model on the feature engineered data for two different use cases:
1. All User: Binary Classifier – Phishing or Legitimate; Supervised; XGBoost model (AUC of ROC = 0.9825).
2. Company as a User: Multiclass Classifier – No of Companies to Detect; Semi-Supervised; DBSCAN Clustering (TPR = 81% and FPR = 0%). This helped avoid almost every phishing attempt made on the Symantec’s client companies with its null FP.
